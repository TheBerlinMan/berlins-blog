# Existential Tech Threats

As humanities technical tools has evolved, so has our list of existential threats.

The industrial revolution brought us an understanding of climate change,
The manhattan project brought fears of a nuclear winter,
and now, AI.

I worry that further technological advancement will only lead to a deeper list.

...

As technology has evolved, we have developed more existential threats to humanity.  

Not including the original asteroid coming in from space and destroying us, we started with nuclear war/winter, added on climate change, and now AI*.  
Does it stand that evolution in tech only leads to more existential threats? Tech evolution is an uncontainable growth. If yes, we are only increasing the odds of human collapse as we go on.

And given that tech evolution is essentially human nature (spear, fire, paper, etc..) does that not imply our nature as a society is to grow until we (with the best of intentions) until we destroy ourselves?

And so on a micro level, every societal participant and non participant is constantly moving towards their own self destruction?



*AI is not a current threat like the other two, but it will likely grow to become one.

** technically the story of a massive incoming asteroid was first, but natureâ€™s nature is always out to destroy us
